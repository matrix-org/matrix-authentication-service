# Configuration file reference

## `http`

Controls the web server.

```yaml
http:
  # Public URL base used when building absolute public URLs
  public_base: https://auth.example.com/

  # OIDC issuer advertised by the service. Defaults to `public_base`
  issuer: https://example.com/

  # List of HTTP listeners, see below
  listeners:
    # ...
```

### `http.listeners`

Each listener can serve multiple resources, and listen on multiple TCP ports or UNIX sockets.

```yaml
http:
  listeners:
    # The name of the listener, used in logs and metrics
    - name: web

      # List of resources to serve
      resources:
        # Serves the .well-known/openid-configuration document
        - name: discovery
        # Serves the human-facing pages, such as the login page
        - name: human
        # Serves the OAuth 2.0/OIDC endpoints
        - name: oauth
        # Serves the Matrix C-S API compatibility endpoints
        - name: compat
        # Serve the GraphQL API used by the frontend,
        # and optionally the GraphQL playground
        - name: graphql
          playground: true
        # Serve the given folder on the /assets/ path
        - name: assets
          path: ./share/assets/

      # List of addresses and ports to listen to
      binds:
        # First option: listen to the given address
        - address: "[::]:8080"

        # Second option: listen on the given host and port combination
        - host: localhost
          port: 8081

        # Third option: listen on the given UNIX socket
        - socket: /tmp/mas.sock

        # Fourth option: grab an already open file descriptor given by the parent process
        # This is useful when using systemd socket activation
        - fd: 1
          # Kind of socket that was passed, defaults to tcp
          kind: tcp # or unix

      # Whether to enable the PROXY protocol on the listener
      proxy_protocol: false

      # If set, makes the listener use TLS with the provided certificate and key
      tls:
        #certificate: <inline PEM>
        certificate_file: /path/to/cert.pem
        #key: <inline PEM>
        key_file: /path/to/key.pem
        #password: <password to decrypt the key>
        #password_file: /path/to/password.txt
```

The following additional resources are available, although it is recommended to serve them on a separate listener, not exposed to the public internet:

- `name: prometheus`: serves a Prometheus-compatible metrics endpoint on `/metrics`, if the Prometheus exporter is enabled in `telemetry.metrics.exporter`.
- `name: health`: serves the health check endpoint on `/health`.

## `database`

Configure how to connect to the PostgreSQL database.

```yaml
database:
  # Full connection string as per
  # https://www.postgresql.org/docs/13/libpq-connect.html#id-1.7.3.8.3.6
  uri: postgresql://user:password@hostname:5432/database?sslmode=require

  # -- OR --
  # Separate parameters
  host: hostname
  port: 5432
  #socket:
  username: user
  password: password
  database: database

  # Whether to use SSL to connect to the database
  ssl_mode: require # or disable, prefer, verify-ca, verify-full
  #ssl_ca: # PEM-encoded certificate
  ssl_ca_file: /path/to/ca.pem # Path to the root certificate file

  # Client certificate to present to the server when SSL is enabled
  #ssl_certificate: # PEM-encoded certificate
  ssl_certificate_file: /path/to/cert.pem # Path to the certificate file
  #ssl_key: # PEM-encoded key
  ssl_key_file: /path/to/key.pem # Path to the key file

  # Additional parameters for the connection pool
  min_connections: 0
  max_connections: 10
  connect_timeout: 30
  idle_timeout: 600
  max_lifetime: 1800
```

## `matrix`

Settings related to the connection to the Matrix homeserver

```yaml
matrix:
  # The homeserver name, as per the `server_name` in the Synapse configuration file
  homeserver: example.com

  # Shared secret used to authenticate the service to the homeserver
  # This must be of high entropy, because leaking this secret would allow anyone to perform admin actions on the homeserver
  secret: "SomeRandomSecret"

  # URL to which the homeserver is accessible from the service
  endpoint: "http://localhost:8008"
```

## `templates`

Allows loading custom templates

```yaml
templates:
  # From where to load the templates
  # This is relative to the current working directory, *not* the config file
  path: /to/templates

  # Path to the frontend assets manifest file
  assets_manifest: /to/manifest.json
```

## `clients`

List of OAuth 2.0/OIDC clients and their keys/secrets. Each `client_id` must be a [ULID](https://github.com/ulid/spec).

```yaml
clients:
  # Confidential client
  - client_id: 000000000000000000000FIRST
    client_auth_method: client_secret_post
    client_secret: secret
    # List of authorized redirect URIs
    redirect_uris:
      - http://localhost:1234/callback
  # Public client
  - client_id: 00000000000000000000SEC0ND
    client_auth_method: none
```

**Note:** any additions or modifications in this list are synced with the database on server startup. Removed entries are only removed with the [`config sync --prune`](../reference/cli/config.md#config-sync---prune---dry-run) command.

## `secrets`

Signing and encryption secrets

```yaml
secrets:
  # Encryption secret (used for encrypting cookies and database fields)
  # This must be a 32-byte long hex-encoded key
  encryption: c7e42fb8baba8f228b2e169fdf4c8216dffd5d33ad18bafd8b928c09ca46c718

### `secrets.keys`

The service can use a number of key types for signing.
The following key types are supported:

- RSA
- ECDSA with the P-256 (`prime256v1`) curve
- ECDSA with the P-384 (`secp384r1`) curve
- ECDSA with the K-256 (`secp256k1`) curve

Each entry must have a unique (and arbitrary) `kid`, plus the key itself.
The key can either be specified inline (with the `key` property), or loaded from a file (with the `key_file` property).
The following key formats are supported:

- PKCS#1 PEM or DER-encoded RSA private key
- PKCS#8 PEM or DER-encoded RSA or ECDSA private key, encrypted or not
- SEC1 PEM or DER-encoded ECDSA private key

For PKCS#8 encoded keys, the `password` or `password_file` properties can be used to decrypt the key.

### `upstream_oauth2`

Settings related to upstream OAuth 2.0/OIDC providers.
Additions and modifications within this section are synced with the database on server startup.
Removed entries are only removed with the [`config sync --prune`](./cli/config.md#config-sync---prune---dry-run) command.

#### `upstream_oauth2.providers`

A list of upstream OAuth 2.0/OIDC providers to use to authenticate users.

Sample configurations for popular providers can be found in the [upstream provider setup](../setup/sso.md#sample-configurations) guide.

```yaml
upstream_oauth2:
  providers:
    - # A unique identifier for the provider
      # Must be a valid ULID
      id: 01HFVBY12TMNTYTBV8W921M5FA

      # The issuer URL, which will be used to discover the provider's configuration.
      # If discovery is enabled, this *must* exactly match the `issuer` field
      # advertised in `<issuer>/.well-known/openid-configuration`.
      issuer: https://example.com/

      # A human-readable name for the provider,
      # which will be displayed on the login page
      #human_name: Example

      # A brand identifier for the provider, which will be used to display a logo
      # on the login page. Values supported by the default template are:
      #  - `apple`
      #  - `google`
      #  - `facebook`
      #  - `github`
      #  - `gitlab`
      #  - `twitter`
      #brand_name: google

      # The client ID to use to authenticate to the provider
      client_id: mas-fb3f0c09c4c23de4

      # The client secret to use to authenticate to the provider
      # This is only used by the `client_secret_post`, `client_secret_basic`
      # and `client_secret_jwk` authentication methods
      #client_secret: f4f6bb68a0269264877e9cb23b1856ab

      # Which authentication method to use to authenticate to the provider
      # Supported methods are:
      #   - `none`
      #   - `client_secret_basic`
      #   - `client_secret_post`
      #   - `client_secret_jwt`
      #   - `private_key_jwt` (using the keys defined in the `secrets.keys` section)
      token_endpoint_auth_method: client_secret_post

      # Which signing algorithm to use to sign the authentication request when using
      # the `private_key_jwt` or the `client_secret_jwt` authentication methods
      #token_endpoint_auth_signing_alg: RS256

      # The scopes to request from the provider
      # In most cases, it should always include `openid` scope
      scope: "openid email profile"

      # How the provider configuration and endpoints should be discovered
      # Possible values are:
      #  - `oidc`: discover the provider through OIDC discovery,
      #     with strict metadata validation (default)
      #  - `insecure`: discover through OIDC discovery, but skip metadata validation
      #  - `disabled`: don't discover the provider and use the endpoints below
      #discovery_mode: oidc

      # Whether PKCE should be used during the authorization code flow.
      # Possible values are:
      #  - `auto`: use PKCE if the provider supports it (default)
      #    Determined through discovery, and disabled if discovery is disabled
      #  - `always`: always use PKCE (with the S256 method)
      #  - `never`: never use PKCE
      #pkce_method: auto

      # The provider authorization endpoint
      # This takes precedence over the discovery mechanism
      #authorization_endpoint: https://example.com/oauth2/authorize

      # The provider token endpoint
      # This takes precedence over the discovery mechanism
      #token_endpoint: https://example.com/oauth2/token

      # The provider JWKS URI
      # This takes precedence over the discovery mechanism
      #jwks_uri: https://example.com/oauth2/keys

      # How user attributes should be mapped
      #
      # Most of those attributes have two main properties:
      #   - `action`: what to do with the attribute. Possible values are:
      #      - `ignore`: ignore the attribute
      #      - `suggest`: suggest the attribute to the user, but let them opt out
      #      - `force`: always import the attribute, and don't fail if it's missing
      #      - `require`: always import the attribute, and fail if it's missing
      #   - `template`: a Jinja2 template used to generate the value. In this template,
      #      the `user` variable is available, which contains the user's attributes
      #      retrieved from the `id_token` given by the upstream provider.
      #
      # Each attribute has a default template which follows the well-known OIDC claims.
      #
      claims_imports:
        # The subject is an internal identifier used to link the
        # user's provider identity to local accounts.
        # By default it uses the `sub` claim as per the OIDC spec,
        # which should fit most use cases.
        subject:
          #template: "{{ user.sub }}"

        # The localpart is the local part of the user's Matrix ID.
        # For example, on the `example.com` server, if the localpart is `alice`,
        #  the user's Matrix ID will be `@alice:example.com`.
        localpart:
          #action: force
          #template: "{{ user.preferred_username }}"

        # The display name is the user's display name.
        displayname:
          #action: suggest
          #template: "{{ user.name }}"

        # An email address to import.
        email:
          #action: suggest
          #template: "{{ user.email }}"

          # Whether the email address must be marked as verified.
          # Possible values are:
          #  - `import`: mark the email address as verified if the upstream provider
          #     has marked it as verified, using the `email_verified` claim.
          #     This is the default.
          #   - `always`: mark the email address as verified
          #   - `never`: mark the email address as not verified
          #set_email_verification: import
```

## `experimental`

Settings that may change or be removed in future versions.
Some of which are in this section because they don't have a stable place in the configuration yet.

```yaml
experimental:
  # Time-to-live of OAuth 2.0 access tokens in seconds. Defaults to 300, 5 minutes.
  #access_token_ttl: 300

  # Time-to-live of compatibility access tokens in seconds, when refresh tokens are supported. Defaults to 300, 5 minutes.
  #compat_token_ttl: 300

  # Whether to enable self-service password registration. Defaults to `true` if password authentication is enabled.
  #password_registration_enabled: false

  # Whether users are allowed to change their email addresses. Defaults to `true`.
  #email_change_allowed: false

  # Whether users are allowed to change their display names. Defaults to `true`.
  #displayname_change_allowed: false

  # Whether users are allowed to change their passwords. Defaults to `true`.
  #password_change_allowed: false
```
