# About this documentation

This documentation is intended to give an overview of how the `matrix-authentication-service` (MAS) works, both from an admin perspective and from a developer perspective.

MAS is an OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Provider server for Matrix.
It has been created to support the migration of Matrix to an OpenID Connect (OIDC) based authentication layer as per [MSC3861](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3861).

The documentation itself is built using [mdBook](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/).
A hosted version is available at <https://matrix-org.github.io/matrix-authentication-service/>.

## How the documentation is organized

This documentation has four main sections:

- The [installation guide](./setup/README.md) will guide you through the process of setting up the `matrix-authentication-service` on your own infrastructure.
- The topics sections goes into more details about how the service works, like the [policy engine](./topics/policy.md) and how [authorization sessions](./topics/authorization.md) are managed.
- The reference documentation covers [configuration options](./reference/configuration.md), the [GraphQL API](./reference/graphql.md), the [scopes](./reference/scopes.md) supported by the service, and the [command line interface](./reference/cli/).
- The developer documentation is intended for people who want to [contribute to the project](./development/contributing.md). Developers may also be interested in:
  - Technical documentation for individual crates: [`rustdoc`](./rustdoc/mas_handlers/)
  - UI components: [`storybook`](./storybook/)
