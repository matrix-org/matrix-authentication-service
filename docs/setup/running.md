# Running the service

To fully function, the service needs to run two main components:

 - An HTTP server
 - A background worker

By default, the [`mas-cli server`](../usage/cli/server.md) command will start both components.
It is possible to only run the HTTP server by setting the `--no-worker` option, and run a background worker with the [`mas-cli worker`](../usage/cli/worker.md) command.

Both components are stateless, and can be scaled horizontally by running multiple instances of each.

## Runtime requirements

Other than the binary, the service needs a few files to run:

 - The templates, referenced by the [`templates.path`](../usage/configuration.md#templates) configuration option
 - The compiled policy, referenced by the [`policy.path`](../usage/configuration.md#policy) configuration option
 - The frontend assets, referenced by the `path` option of the `assets` resource in the [`http.listeners`](../usage/configuration.md#http) configuration section
 - The frontend manifest file, referenced by tge [`templates.assets_manifest`](../usage/configuration.md#templates) configuration option

Be sure to check the [installation instructions](./installation.md) for more information on how to get these files, and make sure the configuration file is updated accordingly.

## Configure the HTTP server

The service can be configured to have multiple HTTP listeners, serving different resources.
See the [`http.listeners`](../usage/configuration.md#http) configuration section for more information.

The service needs to be aware of the public URL it is served on, regardless of the HTTP listeners configuration.
This is done using the [`http.public_base`](../usage/configuration.md#http) configuration option.
By default, the OIDC issuer advertised by the `/.well-known/openid-configuration` endpoint will be the same as the `public_base` URL, but can be configured to be different.

## Tweak the remaining configuration

A few configuration sections might still require some tweaking, including:

 - [`telemetry`](../usage/configuration.md#telemetry): to setup metrics, tracing and Sentry crash reporting
 - [`email`](../usage/configuration.md#email): to setup email sending
 - [`password`](../usage/configuration.md#password): to enable/disable password authentication
 - [`upstream_oauth`](../usage/configuration.md#upstream-oauth): to configure upstream OAuth providers


## Run the service

Once the configuration is done, the service can be started with the [`mas-cli server`](../usage/cli/server.md) command:

```sh
mas-cli server
```

It is advised to run the service as a non-root user, using a tool like [`systemd`](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd/) to manage the service lifecycle.


## Troubleshoot common issues

Once the service is running, it is possible to check its configuration using the [`mas-cli doctor`](../usage/cli/doctor.md) command.
This should help diagnose common issues with the service configuration and deployment.
