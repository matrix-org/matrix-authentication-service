# 1. Who can contribute to MAS?

Everyone is welcome to contribute code to [matrix.org projects](https://github.com/matrix-org), provided that they are willing to license their contributions under the same license as the project itself. We follow a simple 'inbound=outbound' model for contributions: the act of submitting an 'inbound' contribution means that the contributor agrees to license the code under the same terms as the project's overall 'outbound' license - in our case, this is almost always Apache Software License v2 (see [LICENSE](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-authentication-service/blob/main/LICENSE)).
