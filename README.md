# OAuth 2.0 authentication server for Matrix

This is an attempt to implement an OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect authentication server for Matrix, following [MSC2964](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2964).
Don't expect too much here for now, this is very much a work in progress.

See the [Documentation](https://matrix-org.github.io/matrix-authentication-service/index.html) for information on installation and use.
