MAS (Matrix Authentication Service) is an OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Provider server for Matrix developed from 2021 through 2024 as part of the Matrix.org Foundation. The Matrix.org Foundation is not able to resource maintenance of matrix-authentication-service and it continues to be developed by Element.
